We've recently changed our name from [base16-project](https://github.com/base16-project) to avoid any confusion with Chris Kempson's [Base16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16) project.

For the full story please see our post [Base16 Project Lives On (soon to be renamed)](https://github.com/base16-project/base16/issues/51).

Also a big thank you to all of you who have been so enthusiastic and involved in the new organization.
